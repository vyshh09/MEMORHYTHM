**Memorhythm** is a rhythm-based memory game developed as part of a Music course assignment. In this game, the player must memorize and repeat a sequence of musical notes played on virtual drum pads. Each note is associated with a unique sound and color. The game helps players practice their memory and rhythm skills through musical interaction.

## How to Play

1. **Objective**: Memorize and repeat a sequence of musical notes.
2. A sequence will be played visually on drum pads and with corresponding sounds.
3. You must repeat the sequence by either:
   - Pressing the correct keys on your keyboard (Sa, Ri, Ga, Ma, Pa, Da, Ni mapped to keys A, S, D, F, G, H, J).
   - Clicking on the corresponding drum pads on the screen.
4. If you repeat the sequence correctly, the level increases and the sequence gets longer.
5. If you make a mistake, the game ends, and your final score (level reached) is displayed.
